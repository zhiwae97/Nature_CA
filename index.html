              <h2>Intro</h2>
              <p>Seashores, mountains, forests.</p>
              <p>There are not many places like California with such diverse landscape and wildlife.</p>
              <p>But climate change and human activities are taking away this richness of nature.</p>
              <p>Native species in California have declined by 20 percent, and over 600 California species are at risk of extinction.</p>
              <p>Scientists believe the planet is going through its sixth mass extinction.</p>
              <p>But what does that mean for humans?</p>
              <p>We follow three of California’s most iconic species, in an attempt to understand how the future is at risk, for them, and for us.</p>

              <h2>Chapter I: Salamanders</h2>
              <p>For the first stop of our journey, we travel to a pond in Berkeley, CA.</p>
              <p>Small ponds like this are home to a variety of native amphibians, such as the <a href="https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?where-genus=Taricha&where-species=torosa">California newt</a> and the <a href="https://amphibiaweb.org/species/3850">tiger salamander.</a></p>
              <p>These animals return to the same pond they were born in during breeding season. </p>
              <p>However, with prolonged droughts and frequent heat waves in recent years, salamanders often have to face the fact that more and more ponds are drying out. </p>

              <h2>The Carbon-catcher</h2>
              <p>As the most abundant vertebrates in North American forests, salamanders eat insects that would otherwise release carbon dioxide and methane by chewing up leaf litter on the forest floor. </p>
              <p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140310141119.htm">Recently study</a> on Northern California shows that the salamanders play a surprisingly outsized role in sequestering carbon in the soil.</p>
              <p>An estimated 170 pounds of carbon sequestered per acre over the course of a single rainy season could be attributed to salamanders.</p>
              <p>Without them, climate change could get worse before you know it.</p>

              <h2>Chapter II: Acorn Woodpecker</h2>
              <p>One of the byproduct of climate change in California is the incresed frequency and intensity of wildfires.</p>
              <p>In 2020, the River Fire in Monterey County burnt a quarter of Hastings Natural History Reservation.</p>
              <p>The reserve is home to another iconic California specieis, the Acorn Woodpecker.</p>

                  <h2>The "Keystone"</h2>
                  <p>Acorn woodpecker is often referred to as the "keystone" of California's iconic oak woodland habitat because of their unique way of shaping local landscape. </p>
                  <p>They are known for drilling into oak trunks and storing one acron in each of the small holes they make. An acorn woodpecker can drill up to 50,000 acorns in a single tree, sometimes in a straight line up and down the trunk.</p>
                  <p>In Califonrnia, a large number of native species, ranging from other birds to insects, rely on acorn woodpecker holes for nesting and reproduction.</p>
                  <p>As more frequent and more intense wildfires burn through the oak woodlands, acorn woodpecker, as well as other species connected to them, will be forced to abandon their home.</p>

              <p>Pacific Grove is a small coastal town along the shoreline of Monterey County. It is also the biggest wintering site of the Western Monarch Butterfly, the only migrating butterfly in the world and also one of the most iconic species of California.</p>

                <h2>The Pollinator</h2>
                <p>The large and brilliantly-colored monarch butterfly is among the most easily recognizable of the butterfly species in the state of California.</p>
                <p>Because of the state's mild Mediterranean climate, monarch butterflies have been choosing the California coast as overwintering site for millions of years. </p>
                <p>Monarch butterflies generally stay in California from October to early March every year before migrating to Oregon and Washington for reproduction.</p>
                <p>Monarch butterflies are also one of the most important pollinators for California's native plants. They are considered the poster species for all pollinating insects, who are responsible for the survival of over 70% of plants worldwide.</p>

                <p>Researchers are concerned that the combined impact of destructive human activities and climate change may be pushing monarchs further towards extinction.</p>
                <p>The drastic decline of the monarch and other insects has also taken a toll on California's native plant population and argriculture.</p>
